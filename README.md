## Development

Any development help on this project is more than welcome!
New features should be developed in feature branches, and then merged into the `dev` branch to deploy to our [development environment](https://dev.iron-fellowship.scottbenton.dev). Once our dev branch is at a point where everything looks good to ship, we can merge into the `prod` branch to deploy to our production environment.

### Setup

1. Clone this project `git clone https://github.com/scottbenton/Iron-Fellowship.git`
1. Install dependencies `npm i`
1. Set up firebase (see Firebase Setup below)
1. Run `npm run dev` and go to your browser to see the output.

### Firebase Setup

Firebase provides authentication, database, and image storage to this application.

The first step is to create a firebase project. You can do this by going to the [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/). Once you have created a project, you will need to register a web app.

![Firebase Web App Setup](./readme_assets/FirebaseWeb.png)

In order to run the application locally, you will need to set up a `.env.local` file with the information firebase needs to connect to these services.

Once registered the web app, it will give you a config object. Copy the values from this object into your `.env.local` file in the following properties:

```
VITE_FIREBASE_APIKEY=
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTHDOMAIN=
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECTID=
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGEBUCKET=
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGINGSENDERID=
VITE_FIREBASE_APPID=
```

Also remember to enable Google Authentication as provider in your firebase project. You can do this by going to the Authentication tab in the firebase console.
